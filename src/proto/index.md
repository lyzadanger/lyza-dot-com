# Cut and Assemble the Base

Cut pieces of the following dimensions from foam core. These can be cut from a single piece of 7 1/2” x 11 1/2” foam core (slightly smaller than letter or A4 paper):

* Base: 7 1/2” x 5”
* Mounting board: 4” x 6 1/2”
* 4 Mounting board supports: 3 1/2” x 1”
* 4 stability supports: 3 2” x 1/2” and 1 2 1/2” x 1/2”
* 2 2” x 1” pieces

## Assemble the mounting board

Find the center of the (4” x 6-1/2”) mounting board. Mark this spot.

Align your standard-sized servo such that the (need to look up this word: shaft? axis?) is at the center of the board and the long side of the servo is aligned with the short side of the board.

Trace lightly around the servo with a pencil to mark the location.

Take one of the 2” x 1” pieces cut earlier and place the servo on it. Trace carefully around the bottom of the servo, creating an outline on the foam core.

Cut this shape out from the center of the piece, creating a sort of “servo cozy” that should fit around your servo snugly. You may need to cut a notch for the servo’s wires, depending on the exact shape of your particular servo.

Position the servo cozy on the board to match the traced outline and glue in place. The servo should fit snugly and not wiggle.

### Position Arduino and breadboard

Remove adhesive backing from breadboard and adhere it to one side of the servo… (to the left if servo wires are facing you).

Arduino…connections toward short outside side. Attach w/hardware…

## Build the Lower Base

Mark an inner square 3/4” in from all sides…

Glue outside pieces along short edge, centered, add support pieces, glue.

Position battery holder. Mark next to it and glue the shorter (2” x 1”) support there. Add support piece.

Cut the 2-1/2” x 1/2” piece in half lengthwise and glue to the edges of the underside of the mounting board.

The mounting board should now sit on the base with the two small pieces on the outside of the outermost supports.
