Every day, I explore and analyze breaking-edge web and mobile web technologiesâ€”and build real-world projects using them. I specialize in the synthesis of evolving technologies, balancing implementation with speaking, writing and education in the worldwide web community. I love learning and figuring out how to do things on the web and, in turn, showing others how to do it, too.

Together with Cloud Four co-founder Jason Grigsby, I wrote *Head First Mobile Web* (O'Reilly). I'm currently an active, regular columnist on [*A List Apart*](http://www.alistapart.com).
