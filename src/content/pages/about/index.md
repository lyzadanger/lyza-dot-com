Hi! I'm Lyza. I'm a developer and human, native of Portland, Ore., CTO and co-founder of [Cloud Four](http://www.cloudfour.com). I'm a generalist with an abiding love for the Web.

I enjoy figuring things out and blazing new trails in the areas of responsive design, performance, web standards, accessibility and emerging browser APIs. I _especially_ like writing, speaking and teaching about technology.

I've written for _A List Apart_, _Smashing Magazine_, _Net Magazine_ and _O'Reilly_, among others, and am currently working on a writing project about the intersection of JavaScript and embedded hardware.
