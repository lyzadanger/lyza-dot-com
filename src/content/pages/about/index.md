Hi! I'm Lyza. I'm a developer and human, forest dweller of Vermont. I'm originally from Portland, Ore., co-founder of [Cloud Four](http://www.cloudfour.com). I'm a generalist with an abiding love for the Web.

I enjoy figuring things out and blazing new trails in the areas of web-connected devices, web standards, accessibility and emerging browser APIs. I _especially_ like writing, speaking and teaching about technology.

I've written for _A List Apart_, _Smashing Magazine_, _Net Magazine_ and _O'Reilly_, among others, and am currently nearing completion of a new book: _[JavaScript on Things](https://www.manning.com/books/javascript-on-things])_ (Manning).
