Every day, I get to explore and analyze the edge of web and mobile technologies. I'm especially interested in the synthesis of evolving technologies, balancing implementation (I do like to code) with speaking (hi!), writing (scribble scribble) and education (let's help each other learn!) in the world-wide web community.

I can never get enough of figuring out how to do things on the web, and, in turn, sharing what I learn with other people.

Together with Cloud Four co-founder Jason Grigsby, I wrote *Head First Mobile Web* (O'Reilly). I'm currently an active, [regular columnist](http://alistapart.com/author/lgardner) on [*A List Apart*](http://www.alistapart.com).
