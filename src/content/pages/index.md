Have you heard? I am working on a book, [_JavaScript on Things: Hardware for Web Developers_](https://www.manning.com/books/javascript-on-things). It's already in early release (MEAP) from Manning Publications, so you can start reading it today! [Read an excerpt from chapter 3 right now for free](/2016/11/30/voltage-current-resistancewith-gnomes/).

I'm doing a conceptual deep dive into Service Workers at [Smashing Conf NYC June 13th](https://smashingconf.com/speakers/lyza-danger-gardner). It's a pragmatic guide for the uninitiated—will I see you there?
