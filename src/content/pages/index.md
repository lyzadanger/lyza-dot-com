Have you heard? That book I'm working on, [_JavaScript on Things: Hardware for Web Developers_](https://www.manning.com/books/javascript-on-things) is almost done! It'll be published in late 2017. It's already in early release (MEAP) from Manning Publications, so you can start reading it today! [Read an excerpt from chapter 3 right now for free](/2016/11/30/voltage-current-resistancewith-gnomes/).

The video from my recent talk at Smashing NYC 2017 (_A Pragmatist's Guide to Service Worker_) has been posted. [Give it a watch](https://vimeo.com/223432833)?
