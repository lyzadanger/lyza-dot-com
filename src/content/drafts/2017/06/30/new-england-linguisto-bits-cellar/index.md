  Examining my Pacific Northwest heritage linguistically in my new Vermont home
  vis-a-vis the word _cellar_.

_I’m a Pacific-Northwest transplant to northern New England (Vermont). After more than a year here, I’m starting to take more coherent note of regional aspects of language—idioms, vocabulary, phrasing. And I’ve noticed the features of my own language use that stand out._

I know what a _cellar_ is. That’s just not what I call my _basement_. _Where’s the big stock pot?_, you ask. _In the basement_, I will tell you.

Not so with my esteemed neighbors and local colleagues. The extra freezer is _down cellar_. This term is quaint but not rare in American speech: Stephen King has a non-New-England character (hmmm) use it in _The Stand_, for instance. It’s an idiom I would have certainly understood in my previous west-coast reality, but it still strikes my ear as regionally not my own. It has a lovely and romantic sound to it. The space beneath the house is, then, the _cellar_, though I can get away with saying _basement_ without raising eyebrows.

When my neighbor, Farmer P——, sent out an email entreating us to help with a yearly clean-up effort at _the cellar hole_ upstream in our S——- Valley, I thought: how creative he is to call it that! This is my ignorance showing: it’s not an uncommon term locally. I’ve heard it and read it many times since I’ve been here. New England has enough European settlement antiquity to it that cellar holes are common enough and are what they sound like: the remains of an old house, as expressed by a big, sometimes-rock-lined, hole. Obvious and succinct, when you think about it. As a feature of the land, they are not common in the Pacific Northwest, so the pressure to have a term for it is lower.
