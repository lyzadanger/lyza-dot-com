After I gave my talk, _[A Pragmatist's Guide to Service Workers](https://smashingconf.com/ny-2017/schedule/day:tuesday#lyza-danger-gardner)_ at [Smashing Conf NYC](https://smashingconf.com/ny-2017), several folks gave me feedback that they liked the metaphor that I used in a tangent about JavaScript Promises, which you need to understand to be able to understand the [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API).

Here is just that section of the talk. The allusion to the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) is because of its importance to Service Worker. Enjoy? Enjoy!
