                  Four months ago, I upped stakes from my hometown and moved
                  thousands of miles to the middle of the forest in Vermont. I
                  took a break from the Web and changed jobs. Everything has
                  changed…or has<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>it?

              <p>
                Up until a few months ago, I lived in a space-constrained duplex
                in a happening urban neighborhood in happening Portland, Oregon.
                Now I live in the middle of a mountainous forest in Vermont, on
                a dirt road, next to a river. I changed jobs. I got rid of about
                75% of what I owned. On the face of it, everything has changed.
                Or has it?
              </p>
              <p>
                Here are some thoughts on all of the changes, as well as some
                thoughts on how much hasn’t changed at all. In the form of a
                FAQ, because: why not?
              </p>
              <h2 id="wait-where-exactly-do-you-live-now-">
                Wait. Where exactly do you live now?
              </h2>
              <p>
                In a town in southern Vermont. When I say <em>town</em>, I mean
                it in the New England sense: a square-ish area of land roughly 6
                to 10 miles on a side. Not all towns have villages or any form
                of conurbation; ours does but it is about eight miles distant.
              </p>
              <p>
                We live on a dirt road that is well-maintained but is, still,
                dirt. Our nearest neighbors are across the river, about 800 feet
                as the crow flies but a quarter-mile walk to get there. They’re
                the only neighbors within screaming distance.
              </p>
              <h2 id="where-the-heck-do-you-buy-food-and-stuff-">
                Where the heck do you buy food and stuff?
              </h2>
              <p>
                There’s a general store about six-and-a-half minutes away by
                car. The two local villages are each about a 12-minute drive.
                One has a grocery store I’d roughly equate to Safeway on the
                west coast: it’s sufficient but not inspiring.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s remarkable and rewarding how much of our food is obtained
                directly from the humans who made it. We belong to a little CSA
                up the road—it’s personal enough that they’ll notice and comment
                on our absence if they don’t see us for a week or two. There’s a
                Jersey dairy—raw milk and eggs—down the road. Pork and chicken
                often comes from another farm run by a couple in the next town
                over. And one of our neighbors raises grass-fed lamb (and
                may—CROSS FINGERS—scale into acorn-fed pork soon).
              </p>
              <h2 id="what-s-the-landscape-like-">
                What’s the landscape like?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Tons of local relief. Our house is at the bottom of a valley. We
                are surrounded by forest, save for a small field on the east end
                of our property which is used for hay for our neighbor’s sheep.
                I usually say that, aside from that field, you can tell when
                you’re on our property because you won’t be able to stand up
                properly—it’s that steep, most of it.
              </p>
              <p>
                There’s a river. Technically it’s the North Branch of the
                Williams River, but no one ever calls it that. It’s just
                <em>the river</em>. It’s a small river; you can walk across it
                easily, a large creek, really. The water is clear and the rocks
                various and interesting.
              </p>
              <h2 id="so-you-re-off-grid-or-whatever-">
                So, you’re off-grid or whatever?
              </h2>
              <p>
                No, not entirely. So, no. We do have a grid-tied pole-mounted
                3kW solar array, but it doesn’t power the whole house. We’re
                also connected to civilization through our phone/Internet lines
                (more on that shortly). Aside from that, though, yes: we have a
                well, septic. Our heating fuel is provided by an in-ground
                propane tank.
              </p>
              <h2 id="getting-online-must-suck-">Getting online must suck?</h2>
              <p>
                Is that a question or a statement? Here’s the best part of all
                the parts, when taken as part of the beautiful whole: our
                Internet is <em>fantastic</em>. The local telecom got a grant
                from the federal government and used it to invest in a fiber
                grid. We pay a reasonable amount and we get reliable 1G
                symmetric connectivity (real-world performance between
                600-800Mbps). Yee haw!
              </p>
              <h2 id="aren-t-you-terribly-isolated-">
                Aren’t you terribly isolated?
              </h2>
              <p>
                This has been the most surprising thing about this change. I
                expected to have loneliness, to have to work intensely to have
                contact with other humans. And yet. We know all of our
                neighbors. Our front yard and porch are visible from the road
                and sometimes people just drop by if they see us. Our friends
                and family visit us.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometimes we won’t leave our property for four or five days at a
                stretch and it isn’t bothersome at all.
              </p>
              <h2 id="so-you-work-from-home-">So you work from home?</h2>
              <p>
                Yep! I’m lucky to have my position as an Open Web Engineer at
                Bocoup. Their systems and people are well-oriented for
                distributed teams. We’re fortunate to have a real, dedicated
                office portion of our house: a separate staircase, large shared
                office room and a half-bathroom. So “going to work” feels like a
                thing, still.
