                Oh, the year’s almost over! I went to some conferences. I spoke
                at a few conferences.
                <a href="http://cloudfour.com">Cloud Four</a> held our
                first-ever event,
                <a href="https://www.responsivefieldday.com"
                  >Responsive Field Day</a
                >, in September. What follows are my own editorial opinions
                about the good, the bad and the “whatever, enh” cobbled together
                from my three types of involvement (attendee, speaker,
                organizer) in conferences about the web.
              </p>
              <h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>
              <h4 id="my-favorite-shorter-talk-times">
                My Favorite: Shorter Talk Times
              </h4>
              <p>
                I’ve seen a rash of session times ranging from 15-30 minutes
                instead of 45-60. There are some self-evident pitfalls
                here—schedule management, content whiplash, inability to dive
                deep—but for many conferences, this works fantastically for me
                from all three (attendee, speaker, organizer) angles.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a short-attention-span attendee, my interest is held well.
                Speaker energy tends to be more constant, and more focused. This
                leads to more interesting, denser presentations and allows for
                more topics to be included in a single event.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a speaker, I <em>adore</em> shorter sessions. Please. More.
                I’m able to maintain intensity throughout without getting tired,
                and it forces me to <em>focus my thesis</em>. It also allows me
                to be more critical-precise in timing because I’m working on a
                tighter scale. The <em>majority</em> of my most-successful
                presentations have been delivered in shorter time slots.
              </p>
              <p>
                And for organizers, it allows the ability to include more
                content and more diversity of voices in a single event.
              </p>
              <h4 id="more-hat-tips">More Hat Tips</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <em
                    >An increased effort toward speaker and attendee
                    diversity</em
                  >. This is a behemoth topic I won’t dive into here, but it is
                  emphatically front-and-center in our industry. I’ve seen some
                  tactics (gender-blind RFPs, involvement in local community
                  groups) to boost both underrepresented voices as well as
                  giving newer speakers good opportunities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>More sympathy to the efforts of speakers</em>. Non-profit
                  and community events aside, most conferences are in a position
                  to compensate speakers or at the least cover expenses. After
                  all, the speakers <em>are the conference</em>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>More single-track conferences</em>. Being able to have a
                  collective experience minus the session-selection stress leads
                  to a more cohesive feel for many conferences. It’s not a fit
                  for all types of events. But where it does fit, it leads to a
                  stronger sense of a shared involvement without the need to
                  miss out on any content.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="changing-backchannels">Changing Backchannels</h3>
              <p>
                The role of Twitter is changing. For many it remains
                indispensable at conferences. But I’ve also attended a few
                conferences this year from which the Twitter traffic was
                virtually nil.
              </p>
              <p>
                My attitude puts me somewhere in the middle. As a conference
                attendee, monitoring the feed from the hashtag for the event can
                be useful. As a non-attendee (i.e. my other contacts tweeting
                about conferences I’m not at), conference-related traffic is
                effectively useless. Twitter, as always, seems to be a matter of
                opinion.
              </p>
              <p>
                2015 is the year of everyone falling in love with Slack. It
                happened to us at Cloud Four, too (we’ve been using Slack for
                quite a while now, for kind of everything). Slack’s spike in
                popularity has led to its use as the backchannel of choice at
                several conferences I attended this year. On the one hand, it’s
                an efficient and engaging way to communicate. On the other hand,
                it can serve as an inducement to futz around on devices during
                sessions and a disconnect or distraction. The jury’s out on this
                one for me.
              </p>
              <h3 id="the-not-so-great">The Not-so-Great</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <em>Still, a lack of diversity</em>. This concept needs no
                  introduction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Chaos and lackluster schedule control</em>. Complex
                  multi-track events and those with shorter talk times need the
                  commitment and focus of organizers to make sure things flow
                  smoothly. Speakers need to be apprised clearly of time
                  constraints (I showed up for <em>multiple</em> conferences
                  this year to find out—on the day of the event—that my speaking
                  slot was different from what I’d been told in previous
                  communications). I saw some fantastic schedule management this
                  year. I also saw some trainwrecks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>No speakers’ event</em>. I went as a speaker to several
                  conferences this year that had no event whatsoever for
                  speakers. Let me clarify so that this doesn’t sound
                  terrifically entitled. I don’t care if I have to pay for the
                  event out of my own pocket or if lavish food and drink are not
                  served. I just want to meet my (typically admirable and
                  interesting) co-speakers. It’s part of the appeal of accepting
                  invitations in the first place. Not having a chance to meet
                  and interact with other speakers and organizers makes me feel
                  unmoored, disconnected from the event.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>First-come, first-served activities</em>. This is an odd
                  and specific one. A few times this year I saw activities
                  described this way at events—lunches, giveaways—and I cringed.
                  Not only at the pushy-shovy nature this espouses but also in
                  no small part because I have an immediate family member with
                  mobility challenges and I think of her and I get a little
                  bothered on her behalf. I understand that sometimes sessions
                  overflow (however, another argument for single-track
                  conferences!) but there’s something that makes me twitchy
                  about this notion overall.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="a-great-year">A Great Year</h3>
              <p>
                As I recall my year of conferences, what floats into my head is
                happiness. Whenever I speak at an event, I feel honored to have
                been invited, and hope that I am living up to the high
                expectations of attendees and organizers. I’ve attended events
                with crackerjack content and energy. And now I’ve been fortunate
                enough to come full circle and see what it’s like from the
                organizers’ side.
              </p>

                Curious about other conference-goers’ experiences this year!
