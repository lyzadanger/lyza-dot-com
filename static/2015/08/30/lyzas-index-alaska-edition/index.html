                Last weekend, I went to Alaska. I don’t know why it took me so
                long—it’s been almost five years since I went to my last new
                state (Hawaii). In fact, Alaska makes a cool 50—I’ve been to ‘em
                all now.

                Turnagain Arm is a dead-end, long finger of sea extending
                eastward from Anchorage off of Cook Inlet. We drove around it to
                get to the Kenai Peninsula.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cook Inlet—including Turnagain Arm—has a population of Beluga
                whales. Most of the world’s population of Belugas is more
                arctic, and the Cook Inlet Belugas are genetically isolated. DNA
                suggests no inter-breeding with other Belugas for something like
                6000 years. Unfortunately, about half of the Cook Inlet Belugas
                died off mysteriously in the 1990s and the herd (pod?) is still
                struggling to slowly re-establish itself. So I feel doubly lucky
                that I was able to spot a few, just white humps, out in the
                water on this trip. Who knows how long they’ll be around?
                (Source for this: various interpretive signs at Beluga Point and
                Bird Point along the Seward Highway. I have a generally-reliable
                memory, but this is non-robust, source-wise).
              </p>
              <p>
                Belugas are one of my favorite whales (perhaps only beaten out
                by narwhals, which are amazing). They have this lovely demeanor
                and they look like they’d be good friends. I
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beluga_whale"
                  >learned by watching Wikipedia</a
                >
                that they are sometimes called <em>Sea Canaries</em> because of
                their “high-pitched twitter”. And also, through associated
                Wiki-drift, that echolocation and such elaborate chatter are
                restricted to whales that have teeth (Odontoceti).

                We also saw a sea otter in the harbor at Seward. I’ve been
                reading
                <a
                  href="http://www.amazon.com/Alaska-Novel-James-A-Michener/dp/037576142X"
                  >James Michener’s <em>Alaska</em></a
                >, which has a goodly amount to say about sea otters, so I
                wasn’t taken by surprise by how big she or he was. He or she was
                big! And relaxed, swimming on his/her back and grooming and
                pausing to let us take photos and video. Did you know that sea
                otters have the densest fur of any animal? (Both roadsign park
                signs <em>and</em>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_otter">Wikipedia</a>
                agree on that <em>so it must be true</em>.)

                Late August is spawning season for silver salmon on the Kenai
                peninsula, and we timidly peered into solid creeks of flipping,
                disintegrating fish, nervously scanning around for salmon-keen
                bears.
              </p>
              <p>
                We were ill-timed (being mid-moon-cycle) and so weren’t able to
                see the legendary
                <a href="http://www.alaska.org/advice/alaska-bore-tide"
                  >bore tide in Turnagain Arm</a
                >, but I, fascinated with tides in general, console myself by
                the claim that (from highway signs!) the bore tide hasn’t been
                nearly as amazing since the 1964 Good Friday earthquake dropped
                the entire arm’s seafloor by about six feet. The magnitude-9.3
                quake put a number of communities (Portage, Girdwood, Hope)
                partially or completely under flood. They moved Girdwood up the
                mountain a couple of miles. They gave up on Portage entirely.
                Hope starts further inland now, the former water-frontage
                streets now part of the sea.

              <p>
                Flights and crowds in Alaska in the summer are usually painfully
                expensive and painfully present, respectively. However, we seem
                to have found a loophole. Maybe it was fare wars between Alaska
                Airlines and JetBlue, but round-trip flights in August to
                Anchorage from Portland could be had for as little as $157. And
                since we opted to camp, Anchorage’s seizure-inducing lodging
                prices were mostly avoided other than the $275 or so we had to
                drop on an airport Holiday Inn Express because our flight
                (cheap, but…) landed at 2:00 AM. The return flight was also
                oddly-timed, leaving at nearly 1:00 AM, but on the flip side, I
                got to stare, ecstatic, at 90 minutes or the northern lights
                through my window, pale green and beautiful.
              </p>
              <p>
                I recommend visiting this part of Alaska in late August—it’s
                still summer, but the locals are all starting to talk about how
                winter is coming. The aspens are just starting to go gold
                (though the alders are still summer-leafed) and the crowds seem
                to have tapered a little. I’d also like to tout that I didn’t
                get a single bug bite—another benefit of the later season.
                Camping on the Kenai is pleasant and easy, not bush wilderness
                but accessible landscape, landscape far bigger than average.
