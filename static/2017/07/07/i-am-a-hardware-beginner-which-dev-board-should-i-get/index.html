                A question I field often is: “What kind of board should I buy to
                learn how to do this stuff? Where do I start, hardware-wise?”
                And there are two boards I tend to recommend, in the end—which
                is why they figure so prominently in
                <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/javascript-on-things"

                What’s a Development Board?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Let’s not go off half-cocked with a major undefined or vague
                term. What’s a development board, anyway? In my book I use the
                following definition:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  <em>Development boards</em>, also called
                  <em>prototyping boards</em> or just <em>boards</em>, are
                  physical development platforms that combine a microcontroller
                  or other processing component with useful supporting features.
                  They are the bread and butter of the hardware-hacking
                  lifestyle. Boards range in cost from just a few bucks to over
                  $100 for high-end [Single-Board Computers, a.k.a.] SBCs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Boards are centered around their brain, a combination of
                  processor, memory and I/O. 8- or 16-bit microcontrollers are
                  at the center of straightforward, entry-level prototyping
                  boards like (most) Arduinos. Boards with more sophisticated,
                  32-bit microcontrollers may be able to run embedded
                  JavaScript.
                </p>
              </blockquote>

                When setting off on a learn-electronics journey, choosing a
                board is a solid first step. It’ll determine the trajectory of
                your explorations.

                Ideal Things for a Beginner
              </h2>
              <p>
                Features that make a development board ideal for beginners
                include clarity, constraints and ubiquity. Put another way, good
                dev boards for n00bs have simple, obvious features and are used
                by a whole crapload of folks.
              </p>
              <h3 id="clear-intuitive-features">Clear, Intuitive Features</h3>
              <p>
                A good beginner dev board should support a reasonable set of I/O
                features (note: this is usually dictated by what features the
                board’s microcontroller can support). Different <em>pins</em> on
                the board support different features, which should include—at
                the least—digital I/O, analog input, PWM (pulse-width
                modulation), ADC (analog-to-digital conversion) and serial
                support (including I<sup>2</sup>C and SPI). Don’t worry a tick
                if you haven’t heard of any or all of those things yet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pins should be sensibly laid out and named (or, often,
                numbered). Many boards have pin numbering and capability
                information helpfully <em>silkscreened</em> onto the board
                itself. A board with missing key features, nonsensical pin
                layout or a confusing pinout diagram can make you wish you
                hadn’t bothered.

                The more things you can do with a dev board, the more distracted
                you can get. While a juiced-up microcontroller, or more flash
                memory for your programs, or additional peripherals and goodies
                sound tempting, they’re also potentially pits to wallow in and
                get overwhelmed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Limits to the oomph of your first dev board can paradoxically be
                freeing, allowing you to zero in on the fundamentals of
                electronics hackery without suffering from the angst of
                overchoice.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, despite their popularity, I’d recommend against the
                Raspberry Pi family for introductory electronics explorations.
                <em>So much</em> is possible with the Pi platform that it can be
                distracting and overwhelming if you want to focus on electronics
                fundamentals for a bit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, Pis fall short in feature complement: while they certainly
                have some on-board I/O capabilities, their convoluted pin
                numbering, limited PWM (pulse-width modulation) support and
                complete lack of ADC (analog-to-digital conversion) makes
                introductory I/O hackery potentially confusing and frustrating.
              </p>
              <p>
                An aside, though: If you want to tinker around with projects
                that make use of the Pi’s general-computing powers—for example,
                cobbling together a tablet-like PC for your kitchen—by all
                means, do! They are fantastic tiny computers, just not the most
                ideal beginner electronics platforms.The newer
                <a
                  href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/"
                  >Pi 3</a
                >
                is especially fantastic, by the way.
              </p>
              <h3 id="ubiquity">Ubiquity</h3>
              <p>
                When you’re choosing your first dev board, you’re focused on
                learning how to do things with electronics. Getting sidetracked
                by a platform’s idiosyncrasies (or, even, bugs) is not only
                annoying, it can be derailing. At this point in your journey, it
                shouldn’t be your job to figure out whether a component or
                project is misbehaving because of some arcane wonkiness in the
                hardware (or supporting firmware) itself. Working on a
                well-tested platform is helpful here: when an LED fails to
                blink, it’s more than likely pilot error; you can factor out
                most (but never all, truth be told) random flakiness when trying
                to figure out what’s up.
              </p>
              <p>
                And when you do get stuck or confused, it’s awfully nice to have
                a big corpus of support to turn to.
              </p>
              <p>
                For both of these—stability and support—an underlying core
                factor is the platform’s popularity, its relative ubiquity. For
                beginners, choosing a platform that is widely used and has been
                around for a while can be a sanity-saving tactic.
              </p>
              <h2 id="two-different-approaches">Two Different Approaches</h2>
              <p>
                At the end of the day, there are certain dev boards that tick
                most of the boxes time and time again, for each of two
                approaches (and you choose your own adventure here!):
              </p>
              <ul>

                  <em>Learning key electronic fundamentals</em>: In this path,
                  you’re really focused on understanding electronic principles
                  on a fundamental level. This is for you if you’re innately
                  curious about the interactions of current, resistance and
                  voltage (howdy, Ohm’s Law!) and, really, how things
                  <em>work</em> physically. This path is lower-level but leads
                  to a wide competence in low-voltage DC circuitry (believe me,
                  this really does come in handy in life!).

                  <em>Building web-connected devices</em>: This is for you if
                  you have at least a passing interest in the electronics
                  themselves (if you don’t, this post really isn’t for you,
                  anyway), but also have some (software) development background
                  (read: JavaScript). This approach gets you to fully-flung
                  embedded systems faster, in some cases making the vast
                  <code>npm</code> ecosystem of Node.js available to you. This
                  will require a more sophisticated microcontroller/processor
                  than those needed for the first path.

                Ohmigod, how <em>boring</em>! you might be lamenting. I’ve just
                held up the non-cutting-edgiest, pedestrian, and basically
                <em>first</em> open-source board as a shining example of newbie

                Yes, it’s true, the Uno has been around since a long time, and,
                also true, is seriously <em>not flashy</em>, but it really is a
                platform of the people. Its relative stodginess is a blessing
                when compared to the immaturity and fragility of many boards.
                Sure, working with one won’t give you the smug
                <em>frisson</em> of novelty, but it will, in most cases,
                <em>actually work</em>. The Uno does what it says it does. If it
                didn’t, there are a lot of people who’d be irked.
              </p>
              <p>
                Statistics are spotty at best, but even back in 2013, 700,000
                <em>official</em> Arduino boards had been “registered”, with an
                estimated 700,000 additional “derivative or clone board[s]”,
                that is, about a one-to-one ratio (<a
                  href="http://medea.mah.se/2013/04/arduino-faq/"
                  >source</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                Let’s talk about a couple of things here. First: Arduino is a
                <em>family</em> of boards, and the 700k number references
                Arduino boards of all stripes, not specifically the Uno (though
                the Uno is the most popular, and, no, I don’t have a good source
                for that but it <em>certainly seems to be the damned case</em>).
                At the same time, it’s been several years so surely there are
                many more. All right, that’s out of the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                The “derivative or clone board” notion arises because while
                Arduino is open-source, “official” ones carry the Arduino logo
                and can only be made by certain blessed manufacturers.
                Non-official ones are fine, too, but there is a bit of a thing
                with knock-offs that have the logo but shouldn’t, so-called
                <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Products/Counterfeit"
                  >“counterfeit” Arduinos</a
                >, which are cheaper to buy but potentially shoddy.
              </p>
              <p>Here’s how the Arduino Uno R3 stacks up:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <em>Clear, Intuitive Features</em>: Unos have clearly-marked
                  I/O pins, laid out sensibly. An added bonus: pins that support
                  PWM are marked with a tilde (~) and, once again, don’t worry
                  if you don’t know what that is, yet. While Unos certainly
                  aren’t the most svelte form factor, their roominess gives you
                  plenty of space to maneuver. Unos, or, more accurately, their
                  ATmega328P microcontrollers, support all the requisite basic
                  features just fine.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Constraints</em>: That selfsame ATmega328P microcontroller
                  is 8-bit, running at something like 20MHz, and it only has
                  32kB of Flash memory (space for your programs). That’s
                  <em>really</em> constrained. You’re not going to run any kind
                  of (recognizable, let’s not get clever here) OS on that,
                  that’s for sure. But it totally fits the bill for doing all
                  the classic things you do when learning embedded electronics.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Ubiquity</em>: It doesn’t get more ubiquitous. Also, the
                  ATmega328P is a battle-tested microcontroller; it’s reliable
                  and sensible.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Expect to pay about US$25 for a certified Arduino Uno R3,
                considerably cheaper if you’re willing to take a risk on
                reliability, which, at this stage in the game, I wouldn’t?
              </p>
              <p>
                The Uno: unglamorous, reliable, and the <em>sui generis</em> for
                educational hardware hacking. There is really no substitute.

                OK, so there is this fantastic book—brilliant visual design,
                clear instructions, just in all ways excellent. It’s called
                <em>Arduino Projects Book</em>. But there’s a pretty major
                downside: you can <em>only</em> get it if you purchase the

                rocks. It’s worth getting if you can spare the extra funds
                (they’re currently retailing at $85). Of course, there are tons
                of other getting-started books on the market if you Google
                around a bit.

                First Choice for Web-Connected Devices: Tessel 2
              </h2>
              <p>
                And now for something completely different, and lightly
                violating what I said about constraints and ubiquity: the
                <a href="https://tessel.io/">Tessel 2</a> board. The Tessel runs
                an optimized-for-embedded Linux distribution, OpenWRT, and has
                enough oomph to run Node.js on-board. So, if you’ve selected the
                “Web-Connected Devices” adventure, you can <code>npm</code> to
                your heart’s content and do some pretty complex, nifty software
                things in short order.
              </p>
              <p><img src="tessel.png" alt="The Tessel 2 board" /></p>
              <p>
                Like the Arduino, Tessel is an open-source platform. Also like
                the Arduino Uno, the Tessel’s pins are sanely organized and
                labeled and the board supports all the major features you’d
                expect. It’s a more sophisticated device than the Uno, with a
                separate co-processor for handling I/O. There are some frills.
                You’ll likely put the on-board WiFi to use straightaway. There
                are two USB peripheral ports, which are fun to play with but I’d
                recommend keeping it simple to start and ignoring those
                initially.
              </p>
              <p>
                For controlling the Tessel 2, I recommend Johnny-Five, an
                open-source, widely used, cross-platform-compatible JavaScript
                framework.
              </p>
              <p>Here’s how the Tessel 2 Stacks Up:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <em>Clear, Intuitive Features</em>: Tessel 2’s pins are
                  organized into two “ports” of 10 pins each (two power pins and
                  8 I/O). They’re straightforward to figure out. The workflow
                  will feel familiar to web and Node.js developers. The on-board
                  WiFi is a real boon for building web-connected things.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Constraints</em>: The Tessel can do more stuff than the
                  Uno and that’s potentially overwhelming, but if you resist the
                  temptation to futz around with interesting features of its
                  OpenWRT OS and the USB peripherals right away, it can provide
                  a focused learning platform, especially paired with
                  Johnny-Five.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Ubiquity</em>: Straight up, the Tessel 2 doesn’t have a
                  massive user base. But it’s growing into itself and maturing.
                  Johnny-Five recently had its fifth birthday, and has a wide
                  community of contributors and supporters.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                A lot of bells and whistles don’t necessarily make this a
                complicated platform. The workflow is smooth and feels natural
                for Node.js/JavaScript programmers. Johnny-Five has intuitive,
                built-in support for tons of components.
