<p><em>As part and parcel of writing my book</em> (<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/javascript-on-things">JavaScript on Things, Manning</a> ) <em>and scratching the curiosity-itches of my hardware-hacking hobbies, I’ve had my hands on scads of different hardware platforms and components over the past year and more. This series of articles contain a collection of opinions and recommendations based on my experiences as they relate to two focus areas: electronics for beginners and JavaScript-controlled hardware.</em></p>
<p>This post’s electronics experience rating: INTERMEDIATE-PLUS</p>

<p>In a <a href="../../07/i-am-a-hardware-beginner-which-dev-board-should-i-get/index.html">previous post</a>, I identified two standout development boards for beginners. In this one, I highlight a couple of boards that have surprised me by becoming some of my very favorites.</p>
<p>My introduction to Adafruit’s family of Feather boards wasn’t auspicious: while trying to cobble together a little network of LoRA radios (maybe I’ll talk about this more in-depth sometime as a case-study of Never, Ever, Ever Give Up; maybe it’s just too embarrassing), I feverishly ordered several Feathers from Adafruit, amazed that you could buy a tidily-packaged board with microcontroller and LoRA module for ONLY TWENTY DOLLARS.</p>
<p><img src="adafruit-feather-site.png" alt="Adafruit&#39;s Feather line of dev boards"></p>
<p><em>Image: Adafruit Feather dev boards on their website.</em></p>
<p>Actually, you can’t. Tripped up by similar product names, I ended up ordering <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3231">these boards with only the radio module on them</a>, thinking they were <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3178">these $35 boards that actually have a freaking MCU on them, which is highly useful if you actually want to use the radio somehow</a>.</p>
<p>During a protracted evening unboxing it dawned on me that the newly-arrived boards looked rather…minimal. I traveled several miles of self-hate that evening. By this point, the $35 ones with the MCU were sold the hell out, so I scrambled to find another Feather model that I could use to control the first set (it’s Feathers all the way down, ol’ chap).</p>
<p>This time: I ended up with some <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2771">32u4 Basic Proto</a> boards that I wanted to stack with the brainless LoRA Feathers.</p>
<p>Won over I was not. The (limited) <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/assets/41528">pin layout</a> seemed a tad cruel. What’s worse, only four pins have interrupt support and those pins are also the only pins that support TX, RX, SDA and SCL, a rather project-ending bummer when you’re building something that involves serial logging of I^2C sensor readings. Also awesome when I’d already soldered fly wires on the radio-only modules in a 32u4-specific fashion. Three cheers for desoldering wick and chagrin.</p>
<p>A few table-flips later I ultimately netted a small stack of the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2772">Feather M0 Proto</a> boards. Now a few hundred bucks down the Feather rabbit hole, I was steeled for rueful-ironic laughter. And, yet. What is this? These boards fundamentally <em>do not suck</em>. In fact, they’re pretty great!</p>

<h2 id="feather-features-i-like">Feather Features I Like</h2>
<p>There are some features common to many (if not all) Feathers that I didn’t get the joy of experiencing in my initial raging failfires but came to enjoy them once I had my M0s in hand.</p>
<p>I like the boards’ power options. You can plug ‘em into USB power, natch, but you can also attach a LiPo battery to the already-attached-and-waiting-for-yah JST connector and it <em>just works</em>. It’ll charge when on USB power, automatically prefer USB power when plugged in, then automatically switch over to LiPo power when disconnected. This is all kinds of convenient and awesome.</p>
<p>The consistency and commitment to the Feather form factor is handy if you want to stack or otherwise mix boards. There are a number of header arrangements you can choose between. I’d love to see a project that just keeps stacking Feathers on Feathers on Feathers…</p>
<p>Also, minor detail but one close to my heart: the pinout diagrams for the Feathers are clear and well-designed. Just lovely.</p>
<p><img src="m0_pinout.png" alt="Feather M0 pinout diagram"></p>
<p><em>Image: The M0 pinout diagram is clear and easy to read.</em> <a href="https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/030/920/original/2772_pinout_v1_0.pdf?1457305622">Go see it full size</a>. <em>Credit: Adafruit.</em></p>
<h2 id="m0-features-i-like">M0 Features I Like</h2>
<p>I’m going to keep calling the Feather’s MCU the M0, because its actual naming flourishes surpass racehorses/members of the Hapsburg royal dynasty (feast on it: “Atmel® | SMART SAM D ARM® Cortex®-M0+ based microcontroller (MCU) “).</p>
<p>The M0 is a great little friend. Tons of pins, interrupts everywhere, PWM like it’s going out of style, and a not-too-hard-to-mess-with SERCOM for adding/munging serial interfaces (want all six serial modules to be SPI? You can probably do that). Quick compared to the ATmega32u4, with more Flash, more megahertzles, yet still low-power.</p>
<p>Coupled with the little Feather form factor it makes a pleasing platform. Not bad to work with to do Arduino-compatible stuff, once the finicky little bits of IDE/board support are done.</p>
<p>The only un-work-aroundable thing I ran into was a bug in the M0-specific Arduino Wire library (probably?) that made it <a href="https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=111541">impossible to use these boards as I^2C slaves</a> (as master, the more typical setup anyway, they’re fine). One day maybe I’ll go check on the status of that bug.</p>
<p>Anyway, I like this board. Which is funny because I had to go through much pain to find it.</p>
